**Transparency Notice: Qiskit advocate program**

**Introduction**

The Qiskit advocate program, run by IBM, is committed to transparency and protecting your personal data. This notice explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding the data collection. This transparency notice applies to those applying to the Qiskit advocate program and existing advocates joining the new (2025 onwards) Qiskit advocate program.

**What Data We Collect**

When you apply to the Qiskit advocate program or update your details as an existing Qiskit advocate joining the new Qiskit advocate program, we collect the following personal data from you:
- Name
- Gender identity (optional)
- Country of residence
- Email address
- IBMid, Cloud id
- Profession
- Institution
- Discord username
- Slack display name
- GitHub profile link

When you submit a points claim by completing a points-eligible activity in the program, you will be asked for non-personal information about the activity you engaged in, which we collect. We will not collect activity data from you via any other method, e.g. the Qiskit advocate hub on Discord.

**How We Use Your Data**

Your data is used for the following purposes:

- **Program administration:** To manage your participation in the Qiskit Advocate Program, including communication about program activities, opportunities (including global and relevant local opportunities), and updates, and provide advocates with the benefits, resources, and rewards of the program.
- **Community building and recognition:**
  - You will have the choice to share your name and other details with Qiskit advocates and the Qiskit community in the Qiskit advocate hub on Discord, Qiskit advocate library on GitHub, and the Qiskit Slack.
  - We will always ask you before sharing your name, email address, pronouns, and other personal data with Qiskit advocates, the Qiskit community, or to those outside of the Qiskit advocate program (administration) team in IBM, e.g. to facilitate connections and collaborations among advocates and the Qiskit community, or to highlight top advocates in IBM blogs and other social channels. We will never share your details without permission. 
- **Improvement of the program:** Your demographic data helps us evaluate and improve the Qiskit Advocate Program, ensuring it remains relevant, diverse, and beneficial to its members, as well as understand and best allocate the resources of the program. Statistics may be prepared on the representation of gender identity, countries of residence, professions, and institutions in the Qiskit advocate program. Statistics will be created using de-identified personal information and will be shared to limited personnel in IBM to report on and improve the Qiskit advocate program. 
- **Comply with IBM policy:** Your data (country and institution) will be used to determine your eligibility for Qiskit swag and some other benefits of the Qiskit advocate program. In rare cases, you may not be eligible for some benefits of the program due to your country of residence and/or associated institution. Country of residence is additionally required to confirm you reside in a country not listed in Groups D:1 and D:5 of Supplement No. 1 to 15 CFR Part 740 (link) (as may be updated from time to time by the United States government) and Ukraine (collectively, “Prohibited Countries”).
